I am a GW4-CAT PhD Programme for Health Professionals PhD Fellow at the MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit at the University of Bristol and an ST7 anaesthetist in the Severn Deanery.

This is the front page of my new personal website, which is currently under development. You can find more information on my University of Bristol or ResearchGate profiles.
